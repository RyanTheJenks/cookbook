## Instructions
1. Prepare the ingredients
  * Preheat the oven to 450°F. 
  * Wash and dry the fresh produce. 
  * Peel​ and thinly slice the garlic. 
  * Remove and discard the kale stems; roughly chop the leaves. 
  * Drain and rinse the hominy. 
  * Place the tomatoes in a bowl; gently break apart with your hands. 
  * Stack the tortillas; cut them in half, then into ½-inch-wide strips. 
  * Pick the cilantro leaves off the stems; discard the stems. 
  * Crumble the queso fresco. 
  * Quarter the lime. 
  * Pit, peel and medium dice the avocado; toss with the juice of 2 lime wedges to prevent browning.
2. Start the soup
  * In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium-high until hot. 
  * Add the garlic and as much of the spice blend as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. 
  * Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant.
3. Add the pork
  * Add the ground pork to the pot; season with salt and pepper. 
  * Cook, frequently breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 4 to 6 minutes, or until browned and cooked through.
4. Add the kale
  * Add the kale to the pot; season with salt and pepper. 
  * Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until wilted.
5. Finish the soup
  * Add the hominy, tomatoes and 2 cups of water to the pot; season with salt and pepper. 
  * Heat to boiling on high. 
  * Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high and simmer, stirring occasionally, 14 to 16 minutes, or until the liquid is slightly reduced in volume. 
  * Stir in the juice of the remaining lime wedges. 
  * Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. 
  * Transfer to a serving dish.
6. Toast the tortilla strips & serve your dish
